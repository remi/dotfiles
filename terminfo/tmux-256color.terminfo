# A tmux-256color based TERMINFO that adds the escape sequences for italic.
#
# Install:
#
#   tic -o ~/.terminfo tmux-256color.terminfo
#
#   Note: by writing to the home folder, we override the default 256color theme.
#   We could instead save this as another name, but that would report a terminal
#   that an ssh host does not understand, which causes issues with the delete key.
#
# Usage:
#
#   export TERM=tmux-256color
#
tmux-256color|xterm with 256 colors and italic,
	sitm=\E[3m, ritm=\E[23m,
	use=xterm-256color,
