## Usage

Even if this repository is designed so that you can use it as a complete Vim
configuration directory, a better way to use it would be to clone it in a
separate directory and browse its content for settings, key mappings and
plugins that you think might be interesting to you.

```shell
# Clone the repository
$ git clone git://github.com/remiprev/vimfiles.git ~/.vim-remiprev

# Start exploring!
$ vim ~/.vim-remiprev/.vimrc
```
