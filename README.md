# dotfiles

## Introduction

This repository contains all my “dotfiles” — the configuration files used by many command-line tools I use every day:

* [vim](https://www.vim.org)
* [zsh](https://www.zsh.org)
* [git](https://git-scm.com)
* [tmux](https://tmux.github.io)
* [starship](https://starship.rs/)
* [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
* [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
* etc.

## Usage

The recommended way to use these files is to take a look at their content and copy/paste only what you need into _your_ own dotfiles. This will allow you to truly master your dotfiles, as you’ll know what is the purpose of each individual line.
