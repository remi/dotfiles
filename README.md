# dotfiles

## Introduction

This repository contains all my “dotfiles” — the configuration files used by many command-line tools I use every day:

- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [delta](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/)
- [GeekTool](https://www.tynsoe.org/geektool/)
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org)
- [git](https://git-scm.com)
- [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [starship](https://starship.rs/)
- [tmux](https://tmux.github.io)
- [vim](https://www.vim.org) ([neovim](https://neovim.io) actually)
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org)
- etc.

## Usage

The recommended way to use these files is to take a look at their content and copy/paste only what you need into _your_ own dotfiles. This will allow you to truly master your dotfiles, as you’ll know what is the purpose of each individual line.
