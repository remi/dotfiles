# dotfiles

## Introduction

This repository contains all my “dotfiles” — the configuration files used by
many command-line tools (such as [Vim](https://www.vim.org),
[zsh](http://www.zsh.org), [git](https://git-scm.com),
[tmux](https://tmux.github.io/), etc.).

## Usage

The recommended way to use these files is to take a look at their content and
copy/paste only what you need into _your_ dotfiles. This will allow you to
truly master your dotfiles, as you’ll know what is the purpose of each
individual line.
