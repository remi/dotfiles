#Instructions

I don’t recommend that you replace your `.zshrc` file with mine. Instead, extracts lines and bits from them and see how they work and what they do.

However, if you wish to use the whole setup, you’d usually do:

```shell
$ cd /path/to/somewhere
$ git clone --recursive git://github.com/remiprev/zshfiles.git zshfiles-remiprev
$ ln -s /path/to/somewhere/zshfiles-remiprev/.zsh ~/.zsh
$ ln -s ~/.zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```
